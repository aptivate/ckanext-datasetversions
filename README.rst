ckanext-datasetversions
=======================

This CKAN extension adds support for different versions of a dataset. Sometimes
is is desirable to store and display together different versions of a dataset,
for example a daily situation report-style map during a humanitarian crisis.

This plugin provides an action ``dataset_version_create``, for example::

    toolkit.get_action('dataset_version_create')(
        context, {
            'id': dataset['id'],
            'base_name': base_name,
            'owner_org': owner_org
        }
    )

The plugin models dataset versions internally by creating a parent dataset, with
minimal metadata and no resources. A child dataset is created for each version.

``dataset_version_create`` will create a parent-child relationship between the
dataset specified by ``base_name`` and that specified by ``id``. If the dataset
specified by ``base_name`` does not exist, it will be created.

Note that this plugin overrides CKAN's ``package_show`` action. The original
``package_show`` is made available as ``ckan_package_show``.

For datasets with different versions, the overridden ``package_show`` will
return:

* The latest, public, active version of the dataset if the parent name or id is specified
* A specific version of the dataset if the child name or id is specified

The version ordering is determined by the integer value of ``version`` in the
dataset metadata.

In addition, ``package_show`` will return a list of the names and URLs of all
active versions as ``_versions`` in the dictionary.

The plugin provides templates to list versions of a dataset alongside that
currently viewed and to warn the user if they are looking at an old version of a
dataset.

------------
Requirements
------------

This plugin will not work 'out of the box'. You will need to write code to call
the ``dataset_version_create`` action. A site-specific example is available at
https://github.com/aptivate/ckanext-mapactionimporter

This is known to work with CKAN 2.5.2, though note there are problems when
purging datasets with relationships. See:

* https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/3112
* https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/2186

Installation
------------

To install ckanext-datasetversions:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example::

     . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

2. Install the ckanext-datasetversions Python package into your virtual environment::

     pip install ckanext-datasetversions

3. Add ``datasetversions`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``).

4. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu::

     sudo service apache2 reload


---------------
Config Settings
---------------

None


------------------------
Development Installation
------------------------

To install ckanext-datasetversions for development, activate your CKAN virtualenv and
do::

    git clone https://github.com/aptivate/ckanext-datasetversions.git
    cd ckanext-datasetversions
    python setup.py develop
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


-----------------
Running the Tests
-----------------

To run the tests, do::

    nosetests --nologcapture --with-pylons=test.ini

To run the tests and produce a coverage report, first make sure you have
coverage installed in your virtualenv (``pip install coverage``) then run::

    nosetests --nologcapture --with-pylons=test.ini --with-coverage --cover-package=ckanext.datasetversions --cover-inclusive --cover-erase --cover-tests


-------------------------------------------
Registering ckanext-datasetversions on PyPI
-------------------------------------------

ckanext-datasetversions should be availabe on PyPI as
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckanext-datasetversions. If that link doesn't work, then
you can register the project on PyPI for the first time by following these
steps:

1. Create a source distribution of the project::

     python setup.py sdist

2. Register the project::

     python setup.py register

3. Upload the source distribution to PyPI::

     python setup.py sdist upload

4. Tag the first release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the ``setup.py`` file. For example if the version number in ``setup.py`` is
   0.0.1 then do::

       git tag 0.0.1
       git push --tags


--------------------------------------------------
Releasing a New Version of ckanext-datasetversions
--------------------------------------------------

ckanext-datasetversions is availabe on PyPI as https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckanext-datasetversions.
To publish a new version to PyPI follow these steps:

1. Update the version number in the ``setup.py`` file.
   See `PEP 440 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers>`_
   for how to choose version numbers.

2. Create a source distribution of the new version::

     python setup.py sdist

3. Upload the source distribution to PyPI::

     python setup.py sdist upload

4. Tag the new release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the ``setup.py`` file. For example if the version number in ``setup.py`` is
   0.0.2 then do::

       git tag 0.0.2
       git push --tags
